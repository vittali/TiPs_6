I want to connect wireless sensor nodes to the IBM IoT Watson cloud infrastructure {r1} based on the TI Reference Design TIDEP0084 {r2}.
The reference document {r3} is refered to as TI Design in this memo.

== Introduction

The TI Design is based on the BeagleBone Black (BBB) and has become part of the SimpleLink CC13x2 SDK Academy {r4}, more precisely the part of the Academy
covering the {r5}.
The BBB version has been complemented with Linux PC host based version.
I will follow the documentation in the CC13x2 SDK Academy and in the {r6} and revert to the original TI Design only if necessary.


In this project, I will first look at the PC based version, the BBB based version will follow later.

In either case, a _coprocessor_ based on a {r7} is used, which has been the subject of a previous https://www.vittali.ch/5-TIR-1002[memo].


Why this memo ?
